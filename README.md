# IDUG2015
Please dig into any of the Apps to follow the instructions to play with the App!

We are going to take a look at two Apps here:

# Candidates App  
We want to try to figure out the popularity of the Candidates - "Hillary Clinton" and "Jeb Bush", based on the sentiments of the *live* tweets concerning them. All this with minimal _(almost none)_ code and with a drag-drop flow diagram feature that is up and running within minutes.  



# Anomaly Detection App  
We want to leverage Twitter's AnomalyDetection R package to detect anomalies in any kind of data. In this case, the data will the Humidity and Temperature values sent from a device like your own cell phone. Finally we want to have an alert system to notify of the anomaly in the data through text messaging.
